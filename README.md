## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Ping Test:** Measures the latency of a request to [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/get).
- **Download Test:** Downloads a 1MB file and calculates the Mbps.
- **Upload Test:** Uploads a 1MB blob to [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/post) and calculates the Mbps.

All tests run asynchronously and update a visual progress bar with live status updates.


> 💡 This project is designed to be run as a single HTML file with no external JavaScript or CSS files required.

## 🎨 Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3 (with CSS custom properties for theming)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) for UI animations
